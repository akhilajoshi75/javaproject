The provided Java program is an interactive quiz system that enables users to select quiz topics and difficulty levels, answer questions, and receive a performance summary. The program defines two key classes: Question and QuizService. The Question class encapsulates individual quiz questions with attributes such as topic, difficulty, question text, answer options, and the correct answer index, along with methods to retrieve question details. The QuizService class manages a collection of questions, facilitating quiz progression, tracking scores, and verifying answers. The class includes methods like getNextQuestion, checkAnswer, and getScore. In the main function, the program prompts the user to select topics and difficulty levels, displaying questions sequentially and collecting answers in a loop until the quiz concludes. Afterward, the program displays the user's total score and provides a summary of their performance. This quiz system serves as a demonstration of object-oriented programming concepts in Java, offering a user-friendly interface for continuous learning and knowledge assessment.

LITERATURE SURVEY

This code represents a basic implementation of a quiz system. For more complex and feature-rich applications, one might explore existing quiz and educational software. Libraries like JavaFX or frameworks like Swing could be used for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance the user experience. Integration with external APIs or educational platforms could provide access to a broader range of questions, real-time data, and additional features such as user authentication, progress tracking, and personalized learning paths. Furthermore, incorporating data analytics tools can help analyze user performance and adapt the difficulty level of questions to optimize learning outcomes. Advanced implementations might also include features like multimedia questions, time-tracking, and support for multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.

PROPOSED SYSTEM

Input Collection:
The user is prompted to answer quiz questions during each iteration of the main loop. They are presented with a question and multiple-choice answers. The user selects an answer, and the system records it. The loop continues until the user decides to stop answering questions.

Quiz Question:
The system presents the user with a question in the following format.
e.g., Question: What is the capital of France?
a. Berlin
b. Paris
c. Madrid
d. Rome 
The user is expected to enter the letter corresponding to their answer (e.g., ‘B’ for Paris)

Answer Selection:
The user is prompted with the message: "Enter your answer (A/B/C/D): ". The user enters the letter corresponding to their chosen answer.

Adding Another Question:
After each question, the user is prompted with the message: "Do you want to answer another question? (Y/N): ". The user is expected to enter 'Y' to continue with another question or 'N' to exit the quiz.
